                <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
                <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
                    youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
                    team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
                    this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey 
                    background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                <h3>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>DIMENSIONS.</b>IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field 
                    dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</li>
                    <li><b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b> Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum
                        of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state 
                        competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum 
                        requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields 
                        Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver 
                        of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations
                        that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.</li>
                    <li><b>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</b> <ol class="abc">
                        <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas.
                        Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>

                        <li>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal dimensions 
                        and size of goal similarly modified.</li></ol></li>

                            and injuries.</li>
